D001;D(E);Depreciation on fixed and current assets in Enterprises indexed with (E);The depreciation represents the value consumption of goods and impairments of current assets in the Enterprise (E). There are various depreciation methods which are based on legal basis (accounting depreciation, yearly) and on empirical values (calculated depreciation, monthly). Depreciation is spread over the duration of use and represents a regular expense that reflects the continuous loss of value, while impairments represent one-time or unexpected expense that reflect an unscheduled loss of value that was caused by an event (damage, theft, bad debts, outstanding bills, dubious increases on the stock exchange) that lead to a new and continuous status (through legal valuation and factoring).;"Heading: MathDIY fundamentals, subtitle: Depreciation on fixed and current assets.

CONFESSION: Our real-time is still threatended and with it also the real life that was just safe. This proves the momentous 100 and more propositions which are under discussion. Under pressure to justify and in effort to explore the Internet without Frontiers (IwF) I invite you to a next challenge.  Therefore, I asked those who cannot be present and verbally debated with me to record this in writing or to post with a reference to my extraordinary work about Internet Ethics that already mentioned or recommended via Twitter @scifiltr. The work forms the first part for a Digital Constitution for the Internet following the equation: D + I = Y  – Democracy and Internet are Yours. So the first release was a religious creed. The second release should be consists of a macroeconomic value system (MathDIY) which is binding for all responsible persons and companies, stakeholders and shareholders, sovereign states and its politicians and citizens. I believe that only a paradigm shift and a Declaration of Independence could change democratic self-evidence and improve political decision-making that protect us from Agencies, Social Networks, Social Software, Social and Biological Engineering, Data Mining, Broadband, Big and Smart Data, Internet Cartels, A.I., FinTecs and Fake News and corrupted Science.
At the end, the purpose is to unite not to divide the invisible hand of the State with the visible hand of the Webciety by acting in a symbiosis but to eliminate lobbyism and despots and their inversible influences, e.g. abuse, fraud, corruption and reprisals; stopped and revised by official Internet Commitees that were elected or have been entrusted with tasks by the state or citizens authorised by a Digital Constitution for the Internet without Frontiers.";"Heading: Catechism to the Internet without Frontiers (IwF): In the line of duty – Principles and Practices of Digital Ethics, subtitle: The proportion between Democracy (D) and Internet indexed with Yours (Y) are Elements of Yield.

TX002;(D) := I🄨 ⎮§§⎮ > 100;The attack of common sense on the real-time of the captured world by placarding 100 and more propositions.;"Catechism to the Internet without Frontiers (IwF): In the line of duty – Principles and Practices of Digital Ethics.
CONFESSION: At the very beginning there were still 97 theses. Since time does not stand still and the enemies of the Internet without Frontiers do not rest, the theses inevitably had to be supplemented. The Creed of the Internet without Frontiers now relies on 103 fundamental theses. I added the passage « ‚upgrade‘, […] ‚skip‘ and ‚verify‘ and ‚auth‘ » to the first thesis. Based on the theses, I have formulated a Digital Basic Law for my homeland of the Federal Republic of Germany in my mother tongue German. In doing so, I individually examined each individual fundamental right for its applicability to the Internet without Frontiers. I am well aware that, of course, this digital constitution is not one-to-one transferable to other political systems and sovereign states.  When transforming a constitution to a version compatible with the Internet without Frontiers, I roughly considered the following sections: 
1. the essential and inalienable civil rights for user particles;
2. the sovereignty and self-administration of the Internet without Frontiers based on a dual democracy;
3. the legality and discretion of the parliamentary representation of the democratic self-government (exclusive legislation);
3. local participation and self-regulation in the public interest (competing legislation);
4. consultation and operation of joint Internet committees;
5. civil data protection and the institutional Internet representative of all economic sectors;
6. justification of government claim to participation in the data and justified mistrust;
7. border crossing and legislative powers of the Internet Federation;
8. the common practice of digital ethics by administrative and empowered non-governmental organizations;
9. binding joint tasks in setting up and managing critical infrastructures;
10. the Internet jurisdiction;
11. Internet financial budget, finance technologies (FinTec) and blockchains;
12. defense cases and protective measures to prevent cyber attacks;
13. the enforcement of data transfer regulations (data migration) and interaction regulations (traffic control);
14. revision of existing Internet laws including its implementation, non-compatibility and practice security of dual democracy.

In my opinion, you should follow these examples. It´s just a simple equation: Democracy + Internet = Yours. Any small, but negative, change in the separation of powers or in the legal view or restriction of the Internet would be accompanied by a substantial loss of yield (Y). In order to make this phenomenon visible, I have set up my own value system: MathDIY, whereby DIY is not Do-It-Yourself.  It lives and breathes with other schools of thought and doctrines (decision-making, marketing strategy, macroeconomic and microeconomic theory) and provokes, criticizes and rethinks them.
I should have submitted my constructive proposals to responsible authorities. Unfortunately, I believe that they are so busy with their own suggestions that I may not expect much support or any feedback. No one should doubt that I make no effort and that there exists a similar work out there. However, there are many people out there complaining loudly. But there are far fewer courageous scientific arguments. 
Regrettably, when it comes to the fight for Democracy and the Internet, we are all still too obedient and brave soldiers. I do not want to rest. I publish regular changes under the pseudonym @scifiltr and #MathDIY over the networks Ello and GitHub, where also other interested and co-responsible people - without official registration - can follow and read my contributions. Let the two forces - Democracy and Internet - be with you.";"Heading: Catechism to the Internet without Frontiers (IwF): In the line of duty – Principles and Practices of Digital Ethics, subtitle: The attack of common sense on the real-time of the captured world by placarding 100 and more propositions.

1. I am JTH , who watches the 'Watchmen' from 'Once Upon A Timeline' and beyond. You should make yourself a new portrait of profiles and maintain them. Be zealous and make yourself a parable. You should not have other idols besides me, except yourself.
2. You should not misuse clear names of your friends list. You should not lead them or yours in an ineffective way and not let those unpunished who misuse your common name.
3. No holy day of obligation (or tag off) is more sacred to you, vow this voluntary work with an additional hashtag. You can also sanctify and pay tribute to your current status and the status messages of others by stopping (to think) for at least a moment.
4. Thou shalt spare no subject from the Internet and yet leave a monument to ""blocked"" individuals on the Internet. But with stalkers you should not let it come to that. Leak a document and share it with the police. And always leave an IP signature for Internet investigators, but not a private GPG keychain for everyone. Who does not think of fraud, who also does not need to wear an IP-veil.
5. You can not kill the 'shit storm' that haunts you, but repay this injustice only with a 'sit-in' or with an entertainment phenomenon. The same is true for conservative propaganda (or conserved views). 'Once Upon a Timeline' the Homo Android Erectus becomes delicate delicious and ... gaga. Just do not be tempted!
6. You can always cancel or interrupt a connection. Do not repent of this crime. I give you my promise blessing. It's only Internet traffic and not adultery.
7. You should not shout with data, but steal data. Can you - or you do not want it - then lampoon it!

Y001;"(D) + I(Y) = (Y) ≥ Y = (D) × [(N) - (A)]
";Democracy and Internet are Yours is greater than or equal to Yield known as Democracy (D) multiplied with entire Nature (N) minus built up and undeveloped Area (A) ;"In the line of duty: Principles and Practices of Digital Ethics –  Democracy and Internet are Yours in MathDIY. 
ABSTRACT:MathDIY is a simple mathematical notation for describing business and political decision making, capturing its motivation, tensions, processes and context. It can also be a value-based Management Information System (MIS).
MathDIY makes recommendations and suggestions for how determinants of the Interaction Theory by Jens T. Hinrichs and its philosophical sub-disciplines (Catechism of the Internet, Origin of Species on the Internet) can be incorporated into an International Account System (IAS).
The scope extends inevitably to people, nature, democracy and the Internet without Frontiers (IwF), which are to be embedded as variables next to other units in a National Account System (NAS).  The initial equation is (D) + I(Y) = (Y). But Yield is thus influenced by these two forces.
These new determinants must be reconciled with the equation Y = C + I (known as Yield = Consumption + Investment) including comparable constraints (Y = C + S whereby S = Save).  Well-formed syntax allows us to choose addition, subtraction, or insertion method in addition to the equations procedure. All determinants can be converted into a Balanced Scorecard (BSC).
MathDIY finalizes and reflects the balance of Fair External Trade Agreement (FETA) and fundamentally changes the requirements for Diplomatic International Relations (DIR).
On MathDIY, an ecological and social accounting (social balance sheets, Human Development Index, chart of accounts, valuation ratios) based on international added value and value chains should be created. This would make foreign trade and diplomatic relations more comparable and less characterized by scalable economic interests, but based solely on measurable and sustainable facts and valuation standards.
In fact, MathDIY considers a healthy DNA: Y = (D) × [(N) - (A)] known as Democracy (D) multiplied with entire Nature (N) minus built up and undeveloped Area (A).
But MathDIY is not Do-It-Yourself and so it does not yet provide a binding notation nor an application in SVG text or in MathML. At first, the individual explanations should be understood as a constructive contribution to Democracy and the Internet, while getting to know local causes and global effects of wealth creation (Yield = Consumption + Save) and asset utilization (Yield = Consumption + Investment).";"Heading: Catechism to the Internet without Frontiers (IwF): In the line of duty – Principles and Practices of Digital Ethics, subtitle: MathDIY – Democracy and Internet are Yours.

Jens T. Hinrichs says, if Homo Ludens chooses a different game, it will also bring new experience. Maybe Homo Ludens switches the game, because the Homo Ludens is influenced by a new motivation. From the moment own he uses his given experiences he must be creative and become a Homo Faber.

Hj  > Ho > Hi  ∈ Hx";Homo Faber ;"The term Homo Faber (lat., EN: ’the creative human' or 'human as a craftsman') is used in philosophical anthropology to distinguish modern humans from older human epochs by his capacity as an active changer of his environment.
The novel Homo Faber by May Frisch (ISBN: 978-3-518-01087-7) has been translated many times and is often treated in literary studies and in school lessons. His main character is related to the anthropological concept of homo faber, the creative man. The novel is about an engineer with a strictly rational, technically-oriented world view during coincidence and the repressed past break in whose orderly life.

Jens T. Hinrichs uses Homo Faber as a more creatively-motivated human being and Homo Ludens as a more playfully-motivated human being. Indeed, he does not see a strict separation, because a human has different kind of motivation and social characters that depends on the living situation, own level of awareness and decision competences and his role behavior in it. Although he always decides rationally and not on a whim. If Homo Faber acting driven by a whim he falls back into the role of Homo Ludens.

Dahrendorf postulated that an individuum has various social roles in his whole life, which are linked to different norms, values and thus social expectations to which he must submit. These role behavior can trigger inter- or intra-role conflicts. A homo sociologicus always accepting the role which promises him the most benefits and improvements. A distinction is made between mandatory, target and optional expectations. Whilst the expectations given from the society, the individual has no influence on them, he can not escape them. As a result, people tend to adopt negative norms without questioning them, thereby sanctioning themselves accordingly, sometimes negatively in the event of non-compliance.

Although every human being is subject to an individual mixture of norms and expectations that determine his actions. If we follow this assumption strictly, an individuum would not be capable of free will. At least, the theory of homo sociologicus has therefore often had to accept critics.

In macroeconomics, this theory is also often used as a so-called representative agent to analyze economic processes. A frequently used special case of Homo oeconomicus is the time-consistent expectancy utility maximizer, with which the behavioral economics in particular deals.

The terms ""rational agent"" or ""utility maximizer"" are used more often in economic literature, while the term ""homo oeconomicus"" is an allusion to Homo sapiens within the taxonomy of Homo-Epitheta, is used more inside of antrophology.

The model is used to explain elementary economic relationships. It has been controversial discussed whether a purely egotistical order of preference should be a defining his characteristic. In the meantime, it has become widely accepted that the homo-oeconomic model is better understood as a active role model that fulfills rationality assumptions whereby the actor make a preference order out of any preference relation.
The decision of a homo oeconomicus can be described as maximizing a utility function. The theory of utility theory is of fundamental importance for both microeconomics and macroeconomics.

Meckling. With REMM, Meckling has already developed an actor model that has both homo oeconomicus and homo sociologicus properties. Lindenberg has added two more characteristics to this model: restrictions (material and social limitations) and expectations.

The socio-scientific action model of homo socio oeconomicus unites the essential characteristics of homo oeconomicus and homo sociologicus.
 In contrast to homo sociologicus and homo oeconomicus, is an open model that can be applied to both economic and sociological questions. The homo socio-oeconomicus makes its decisions based on rational benefit considerations or the actor takes into account that the choice of action can also be influenced by social determinants such as social role, social status, reference groups, consumer preferences.
  The Homo Socio Economique is equipped with features that enable him to survive among competitors, regardless of market failure, while a certain degree of competence and rationality is assumed.
 The homo socio oeconomicus is not overwhelmed. In fact, he would have to make agreements or conclude contracts with other actos. Also, the homo socio oeconomicus is able to tune his behavior to his social environment and contact.

Hinrichs brings the essential characteristics of homo oeconomicus and homo sociologicus into harmony with its environment. His extended model is about the maximizing man (M) in the social media economy (M) or homo socio-oeconomicus that set forth his life in the Internet (second life) or everlast in a stand-by modus (M) known as parallel RREEMM-sleep (resourceful, restricted, expecting, evaluating, maximizing man, media literacy, stand-by modus, latent mechanism and motivation behind; comp. Meckling, Lindenberg).
 
In addition, his dissatisfaction with the socio-economic actor model and the data traffic of the commercial Internet has led him to develop an interactive action model that seeks to combine the merits of previous doctrines taking into account a certain degree of awareness (online status) and social media literacy or equal social and technical competences.
 Indeed, his interactive action model postulated that although the decisions of many people are appreciated, evaluated and recommended, but single persons and just a few actors are overwhelmed with decisions even though they all have market intelligence and decision-making tools, but based on that they make no rational selection always or often, because homo socios oeconomicus don’t understand the mechanism (M) and motivation (M) behind algorithm, social engineers, social software even he his organizised.

Since December of 2017 the Homo Socios Oeconomicus is also a definition for humans acting out of a specific motivation (mover, bystander, opposer, follower, influencer, activist etc.) embedded in the Information society and the Digital economy or in an Internet without Frontiers (IwF), the globalization per se - based on the local user particles together with adhering particles. Jens T. Hinrichs formulate and order the Homo Socios Oeconomicus as an intrinsic factor embedded in a social group, fabric or system (social network, platform, health system, degree of individual satisfaction, social media literacy, creed of digital ethics, iPotency).

Otherwise, the Interaction Theory of Jens T. Hinrichs essentially deals with him as a user particle. The Homo Socios Oeconomicus is the reflection of Homo Sociologicus (human being in society) by Ralph Dahrendorf [Paperback, Publisher: UTB / West German; Edition: 13. (1974), ASIN: 3531112139] applied on contemporary phenomena (right-wing populism, pathological Internet addiction) - with regard to his psychology and sociology - and applied to the revolutionary character of Erich Fromm [eBook, publisher: Open Publishing Rights GmbH, Munich, ISBN: 978-3-95912-060-9].

Jens T. Hinrichs also take into account the preference and reward system of Homo sapiens applied on the Internet (spider monkey, mention) and other Origin of Species by Charles Darwin (theory of evolution) according to main issues (interaction and data).

It’s about the manifestation of a regression in Internet Darwinism as a result of Internet civilization.  A Homo Fragilus Immutabilis is willing to talk extensively about private life on the Internet, but is skeptical of completing forms. The Homo Fragilus Immutabilis is a confident, captured social character who likes to give deeper insights about personal data and intimacy to social network but deny access to encryption or cryptography. Denied data retention, but allows data to be relegated to social networks.
Since January 2016, the Interaction Theory of Jens T. Hinrichs postulates, among other things, that the real life on the Internet will be continued only in an individual-transformed state of aggregation. The human being continuing life and completing content – free of charges and elsewhere on Cyberspace – if the human is willingly and permanently substituted his real life. The Homo Fragilus Immutabilis conditioned and trivialized entertainment phenomena and takes dwellings and surreality more important than the ‚real‘ real-time. Such interaction processes Jens T. Hinrichs refers to as data bloodletting.
The total opposite of the Homo Fragilus Immutabilis is the Homo Fragilus Libertate, which can escape these constraints and take necessary precautions or take countermeasures. Sometimes the species of Homo Fragilus needs a little time to learn from mistakes, and then to be able to consistently apply his playful experiences, where these species first has to slip into the role of Homo Ludens or that of Homo Faber. However, In that interaction of cause and effect the human make a step back in time in the evolution process and loses his progress so far, hopefully temporarily.";"Heading: MathDIY fundamentals, subheading: The Origin of Species  - the human as an economic (f)actor.
