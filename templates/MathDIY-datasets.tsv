D001	D(E)	Depreciation on fixed and current assets in Enterprises indexed with (E)	The depreciation represents the value consumption of goods and impairments of current assets in the Enterprise (E). There are various depreciation methods which are based on legal basis (accounting depreciation, yearly) and on empirical values (calculated depreciation, monthly). Depreciation is spread over the duration of use and represents a regular expense that reflects the continuous loss of value, while impairments represent one-time or unexpected expense that reflect an unscheduled loss of value that was caused by an event (damage, theft, bad debts, outstanding bills, dubious increases on the stock exchange) that lead to a new and continuous status (through legal valuation and factoring).

CONFESSION: Our real-time is still threatended and with it also the real life that was just safe. This proves the momentous 100 and more propositions which are under discussion. Under pressure to justify and in effort to explore the Internet without Frontiers (IwF) I invite you to a next challenge.  Therefore, I asked those who cannot be present and verbally debated with me to record this in writing or to post with a reference to my extraordinary work about Internet Ethics that already mentioned or recommended via Twitter @scifiltr. The work forms the first part for a Digital Constitution for the Internet following the equation: D + I = Y  – Democracy and Internet are Yours. So the first release was a religious creed. The second release should be consists of a macroeconomic value system (MathDIY) which is binding for all responsible persons and companies, stakeholders and shareholders, sovereign states and its politicians and citizens. I believe that only a paradigm shift and a Declaration of Independence could change democratic self-evidence and improve political decision-making that protect us from Agencies, Social Networks, Social Software, Social and Biological Engineering, Data Mining, Broadband, Big and Smart Data, Internet Cartels, A.I., FinTecs and Fake News and corrupted Science.
At the end, the purpose is to unite not to divide the invisible hand of the State with the visible hand of the Webciety by acting in a symbiosis but to eliminate lobbyism and despots and their inversible influences, e.g. abuse, fraud, corruption and reprisals; stopped and revised by official Internet Commitees that were elected or have been entrusted with tasks by the state or citizens authorised by a Digital Constitution for the Internet without Frontiers."

TX002	(D) := I🄨 ⎮§§⎮ > 100	The attack of common sense on the real-time of the captured world by placarding 100 and more propositions.	"Catechism to the Internet without Frontiers (IwF): In the line of duty – Principles and Practices of Digital Ethics.
CONFESSION: At the very beginning there were still 97 theses. Since time does not stand still and the enemies of the Internet without Frontiers do not rest, the theses inevitably had to be supplemented. The Creed of the Internet without Frontiers now relies on 103 fundamental theses. I added the passage « ‚upgrade‘, […] ‚skip‘ and ‚verify‘ and ‚auth‘ » to the first thesis. Based on the theses, I have formulated a Digital Basic Law for my homeland of the Federal Republic of Germany in my mother tongue German. In doing so, I individually examined each individual fundamental right for its applicability to the Internet without Frontiers. I am well aware that, of course, this digital constitution is not one-to-one transferable to other political systems and sovereign states.  When transforming a constitution to a version compatible with the Internet without Frontiers, I roughly considered the following sections: 
1. the essential and inalienable civil rights for user particles;
2. the sovereignty and self-administration of the Internet without Frontiers based on a dual democracy;
3. the legality and discretion of the parliamentary representation of the democratic self-government (exclusive legislation);
3. local participation and self-regulation in the public interest (competing legislation);
4. consultation and operation of joint Internet committees;
5. civil data protection and the institutional Internet representative of all economic sectors;
6. justification of government claim to participation in the data and justified mistrust;
7. border crossing and legislative powers of the Internet Federation;
8. the common practice of digital ethics by administrative and empowered non-governmental organizations;
9. binding joint tasks in setting up and managing critical infrastructures;
10. the Internet jurisdiction;
11. Internet financial budget, finance technologies (FinTec) and blockchains;
12. defense cases and protective measures to prevent cyber attacks;
13. the enforcement of data transfer regulations (data migration) and interaction regulations (traffic control);
14. revision of existing Internet laws including its implementation, non-compatibility and practice security of dual democracy.

In my opinion, you should follow these examples. It´s just a simple equation: Democracy + Internet = Yours. Any small, but negative, change in the separation of powers or in the legal view or restriction of the Internet would be accompanied by a substantial loss of yield (Y). In order to make this phenomenon visible, I have set up my own value system: MathDIY, whereby DIY is not Do-It-Yourself.  It lives and breathes with other schools of thought and doctrines (decision-making, marketing strategy, macroeconomic and microeconomic theory) and provokes, criticizes and rethinks them.
I should have submitted my constructive proposals to responsible authorities. Unfortunately, I believe that they are so busy with their own suggestions that I may not expect much support or any feedback. No one should doubt that I make no effort and that there exists a similar work out there. However, there are many people out there complaining loudly. But there are far fewer courageous scientific arguments. 
Regrettably, when it comes to the fight for Democracy and the Internet, we are all still too obedient and brave soldiers. I do not want to rest. I publish regular changes under the pseudonym @scifiltr and #MathDIY over the networks Ello and GitHub, where also other interested and co-responsible people - without official registration - can follow and read my contributions. Let the two forces - Democracy and Internet - be with you."

"In the line of duty: Principles and Practices of Digital Ethics – The zen-like Ten Commandments for the Internet without Frontiers (IwF)
1. I am JTH , who watches the 'Watchmen' from 'Once Upon A Timeline' and beyond. You should make yourself a new portrait of profiles and maintain them. Be zealous and make yourself a parable. You should not have other idols besides me, except yourself.
2. You should not misuse clear names of your friends list. You should not lead them or yours in an ineffective way and not let those unpunished who misuse your common name.
3. No holy day of obligation (or tag off) is more sacred to you, vow this voluntary work with an additional hashtag. You can also sanctify and pay tribute to your current status and the status messages of others by stopping (to think) for at least a moment.
4. Thou shalt spare no subject from the Internet and yet leave a monument to ""blocked"" individuals on the Internet. But with stalkers you should not let it come to that. Leak a document and share it with the police. And always leave an IP signature for Internet investigators, but not a private GPG keychain for everyone. Who does not think of fraud, who also does not need to wear an IP-veil.
5. You can not kill the 'shit storm' that haunts you, but repay this injustice only with a 'sit-in' or with an entertainment phenomenon. The same is true for conservative propaganda (or conserved views). 'Once Upon a Timeline' the Homo Android Erectus becomes delicate delicious and ... gaga. Just do not be tempted!
6. You can always cancel or interrupt a connection. Do not repent of this crime. I give you my promise blessing. It's only Internet traffic and not adultery.
7. You should not shout with data, but steal data. Can you - or you do not want it - then lampoon it!

Y001	"(D) + I(Y) = (Y) ≥ Y = (D) × [(N) - (A)]
"	Democracy and Internet are Yours is greater than or equal to Yield known as Democracy (D) multiplied with entire Nature (N) minus built up and undeveloped Area (A) 	"In the line of duty: Principles and Practices of Digital Ethics –  Democracy and Internet are Yours in MathDIY. 
ABSTRACT:MathDIY is a simple mathematical notation for describing business and political decision making, capturing its motivation, tensions, processes and context. It can also be a value-based Management Information System (MIS).
MathDIY makes recommendations and suggestions for how determinants of the Interaction Theory by Jens T. Hinrichs and its philosophical sub-disciplines (Catechism of the Internet, Origin of Species on the Internet) can be incorporated into an International Account System (IAS).
The scope extends inevitably to people, nature, democracy and the Internet without Frontiers (IwF), which are to be embedded as variables next to other units in a National Account System (NAS).  The initial equation is (D) + I(Y) = (Y). But Yield is thus influenced by these two forces.
These new determinants must be reconciled with the equation Y = C + I (known as Yield = Consumption + Investment) including comparable constraints (Y = C + S whereby S = Save).  Well-formed syntax allows us to choose addition, subtraction, or insertion method in addition to the equations procedure. All determinants can be converted into a Balanced Scorecard (BSC).
MathDIY finalizes and reflects the balance of Fair External Trade Agreement (FETA) and fundamentally changes the requirements for Diplomatic International Relations (DIR).
On MathDIY, an ecological and social accounting (social balance sheets, Human Development Index, chart of accounts, valuation ratios) based on international added value and value chains should be created. This would make foreign trade and diplomatic relations more comparable and less characterized by scalable economic interests, but based solely on measurable and sustainable facts and valuation standards.
In fact, MathDIY considers a healthy DNA: Y = (D) × [(N) - (A)] known as Democracy (D) multiplied with entire Nature (N) minus built up and undeveloped Area (A).
But MathDIY is not Do-It-Yourself and so it does not yet provide a binding notation nor an application in SVG text or in MathML. At first, the individual explanations should be understood as a constructive contribution to Democracy and the Internet, while getting to know local causes and global effects of wealth creation (Yield = Consumption + Save) and asset utilization (Yield = Consumption + Investment)."
