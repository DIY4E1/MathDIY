With MathDIY we turn the previous doctrines upside down. Therefore we visualize the figures in separate files and add them to the folder <a href="https://github.com/scifiltr/MathDIY/tree/master/attachments">attachments</a> and show with <a href="https://github.com/scifiltr/MathDIY/tree/master/templates">templates</a> how the principles of MathDIY should be used in practice.<br>
You may have noticed that everyone involved in a process try hard to work in a team, but thinks and acts as individuals. Then MathDIY comes into play. At this point we only want to show a small selection.
