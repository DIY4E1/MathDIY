# MathDIY
Democracy (D) and Internet (I) are Yours (Y) stands for a macroeconomic value system created by Jens T. Hinrichs, but he does not yet provide an XML application. However, we have compatible data records for data warehouses (.csv, .tsv and so on). As of today, the documentation includes more than 250 mathematical formulations and its explanations.

# Abstract
MathDIY is a simple mathematical notation for describing business and political decision making, capturing its motivation, tensions, processes and context. It can also be a value-based Management Information System (MIS).<br>
<br>
MathDIY makes recommendations and suggestions for how determinants of the Interaction Theory by Jens T. Hinrichs and its philosophical subdisciplines (Catechism of the Internet, Origin of Species on the Internet) can be incorporated into an International Account System (IAS).<br>
<br>
The scope extends inevitably to people, nature, democracy and the Internet without Frontiers (IwF), which are to be embedded as variables next to other units in a National Account System (NAS). The initial equation is D + I = Y (known as Democracy and Internet are Yours). Yield is thus influenced by these two forces.<br>
<br>
These new determinants must be reconciled with Y = C + I (known as Yield = Consumption + Investment) including comparable constraints (Y = C + S whereby S = Save). Well-formed syntax allows us to choose addition, subtraction, or insertion method in addition to the equations procedure. All determinants can be converted into a Balanced Scorecard (BSC).<br>
<br>
MathDIY finalizes and reflects the balance of Fair External Trade Agreement (FETA) and fundamentally changes the requirements for Diplomatic International Relations (DIR).<br>
<br>
On MathDIY, an ecological and social accounting (social balance sheets, Human Development Index, chart of accounts, valuation ratios) based on international added value and value chains should be created. This would make foreign trade and diplomatic relations more comparable and less characterized by scalable economic interests, but based solely on measurable and sustainable facts and valuation standards.

# Sketches
With MathDIY we turn the previous doctrines upside down. Therefore we visualize the figures in separate file attachments and show with templates how the principles of MathDIY should be used in practice.<br>
You may have noticed that everyone involved in a process try hard to work in a team, but thinks and acts as individuals. Then MathDIY comes into play. At this point we only want to show a small selection
