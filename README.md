# MathDIY
Democracy (D) and Internet are Yours (Y) stands for a macroeconomic value system created by Jens T. Hinrichs, but he does not yet provide an mobile application or programming interface. However, he has compatible data records for data warehouses (.csv, .tsv) or websites (.json). As of today, the documentation includes more than 250 mathematical formulations and its explanations.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
MathDIY is a simple mathematical notation for describing business and political decision making, capturing its motivation, tensions, processes and context. It can also be a value-based Management Information System (MIS).<br>
<br>
MathDIY makes recommendations and suggestions for how determinants of the Interaction Theory by Jens T. Hinrichs and its philosophical subdisciplines (Catechism of the Internet, Origin of Species on the Internet) can be incorporated into an International Account System (IAS).<br>
<br>
The scope extends inevitably to people, nature, democracy and the Internet without Frontiers (IwF), which are to be embedded as variables next to other units in a National Account System (NAS). The initial equation is (D) + I<sub>(Y)</sub> = Yours (known as Democracy and Internet are Yours). Yield is thus influenced by these two forces.<br>
<br>
These new determinants must be reconciled with Y = C + I (known as Yield = Consumption + Investment) including comparable constraints (Y = C + S whereby S = Save). Well-formed syntax allows us to choose addition, subtraction, or insertion method in addition to the equations procedure. All determinants can be converted into a Balanced Scorecard (BSC).<br>
<br>
MathDIY finalizes and reflects the balance of Fair External Trade Agreement (FETA) and fundamentally changes the requirements for Diplomatic International Relations (DIR).<br>
<br>
On MathDIY, an ecological and social accounting (social balance sheets, Human Development Index, chart of accounts, valuation ratios) based on international added value and value chains should be created. This would make foreign trade and diplomatic relations more comparable and less characterized by scalable economic interests, but based solely on measurable and sustainable facts and valuation standards.
<h2>DNA</h2>
The DNA factors in MathDIY answer whether there is a measure of value for democracies that conduct world trade with autocracies. In addition, these DNA factors should answer whether it makes sense to calculate many times more for bottled water than for sewage, tap water or irrigation.<br><br>

The DNA factors strictly differentiate between the moral perception of individuals, what nature means and how nature is to be ethically evaluated according to democratic principles. The DNA equation in MathDIY is (Y) ≥ Y = (D) ×  [(N) - (A)]. Essentially, this means nothing other than Democracy and Internet are Yours (Y) is greater than or equal to Yield known as Democracy (D) multiplied with entire Nature (N) minus built up and undeveloped Area (A). So it's very simple. The paradigm shift puts an end to excuses.<br><br>

<h2>Sketches</h2>
With MathDIY we turn the previous doctrines upside down. Therefore we visualize the figures in separate files and add them to the folder <a href="https://github.com/scifiltr/MathDIY/tree/master/attachments">attachments</a> and show with <a href="https://github.com/scifiltr/MathDIY/tree/master/templates">templates</a> how the principles of MathDIY should be used in practice.<br>
You may have noticed that everyone involved in a process try hard to work in a team, but thinks and acts as individuals. Then MathDIY comes into play.
